# Storage Account

This terraform module simplifies the process of creating and managing storage accounts on azure with customizable options and features, offering a flexible and powerful solution for managing azure storage through code.

## Goals

The main objective is to create a more logic data structure, achieved by combining and grouping related resources together in a complex object.

The structure of the module promotes reusability. It's intended to be a repeatable component, simplifying the process of building diverse workloads and platform accelerators consistently.

A primary goal is to utilize keys and values in the object that correspond to the REST API's structure. This enables us to carry out iterations, increasing its practical value as time goes on.

A last key goal is to separate logic from configuration in the module, thereby enhancing its scalability, ease of customization, and manageability.

## Features

- offers support for shares, tables, containers, and queues.
- employs management policies using a variety of rules.
- provides advanced threat protection capabilities.
- utilization of terratest for robust validation.
- facilitates cors to securely control access to assets across different domains.

The below examples shows the usage when consuming the module:

## Usage: simple

```hcl
module "storage" {
  source = "github.com/cloudnationhq/az-cn-module-tf-sa"

  storage = {
    name          = module.naming.storage_account.name_unique
    location      = module.rg.groups.demo.location
    resourcegroup = module.rg.groups.demo.name
  }
}
```

## Usage: queues

```hcl
module "storage" {
  source = "github.com/cloudnationhq/az-cn-module-tf-sa"

  naming = local.naming

  storage = {
    name          = module.naming.storage_account.name_unique
    location      = module.rg.groups.demo.location
    resourcegroup = module.rg.groups.demo.name

    queue_properties = {
      logging = {
        read              = true
        retention_in_days = 8
      }

      queues = {
        q1 = {
          metadata = {
            environment = "dev"
            owner       = "finance team"
            purpose     = "transaction_processing"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage: blob containers

```hcl
module "storage" {
  source = "github.com/cloudnationhq/az-cn-module-tf-sa"

  naming = local.naming

  storage = {
    name          = module.naming.storage_account.name_unique
    location      = module.rg.groups.demo.location
    resourcegroup = module.rg.groups.demo.name

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage: shares

```hcl
module "storage" {
  source = "github.com/cloudnationhq/az-cn-module-tf-sa"

  naming = local.naming

  storage = {
    name          = module.naming.storage_account.name_unique
    location      = module.rg.groups.demo.location

## Testing

The github repository utilizes a Makefile to conduct tests to evaluate and validate different configurations of the module. These tests are designed to enhance its stability and reliability.

Before initiating the tests, please ensure that both go and terraform are properly installed on your system.

The [Makefile](Makefile) incorporates three distinct test variations. The first one, a local deployment test, is designed for local deployments and allows the overriding of workload and environment values. It includes additional checks and can be initiated using the command ```make test_local```.

The second variation is an extended test. This test performs additional validations and serves as the default test for the module within the github workflow.

The third variation allows for specific deployment tests. By providing a unique test name in the github workflow, it overrides the default extended test, executing the specific deployment test instead.

Each of these tests contributes to the robustness and resilience of the module. They ensure the module performs consistently and accurately under different scenarios and configurations.

## Notes

Using a dedicated module, we've developed a naming convention for resources that's based on specific regular expressions for each type, ensuring correct abbreviations and offering flexibility with multiple prefixes and suffixes
